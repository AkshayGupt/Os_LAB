case $ch in
1)

echo enter a letter
read ch

case $ch in 

A)
echo "letter A"
;;
B)
echo "letter B"
;;
*)
echo not A nd B
esac

[A-Z] includes all characters between A to Z .

  case $ch in

  [A-Z]) 
  echo 'upper case lette'
  ;;
  [A-Z]*)
  echo 'letter B'
  ;;
  *)
  echo not a and b
  ;;

  letter=A case 1 will be executed
  letter = AZ case 2
